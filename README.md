I've created a beautiful, interactive BBQ chicken shopping list builder! Here's what it does:
🍗 Dynamic Portions - Adjust servings from 1-20 people using the +/- buttons or quick presets (2, 4, 6, 8, or 12 people)
✅ Interactive Checklist - Tap any ingredient to check it off as you shop, with smooth animations
📊 Progress Tracking - A visual progress ring shows how many items you've gathered
🔥 Smart Quantities - All 12 ingredients automatically recalculate with nice fraction formatting (½, ¼, etc.)
Try adjusting the portions to see all the ingredient quantities update instantly! You can also customize the title and colors through Canva's editing panel.
